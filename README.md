Customer Support Data Analysis (SQL + Python)
Welcome to this project where we explore a Customer Support database using SQL queries within a Python environment (using libraries like sqlite3 and pandas).

This repository includes SQL scripts to perform various analyses, like ticket volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores, and more.

Technologies Used
Python (for executing SQL queries)

SQLite (lightweight database)

Pandas (for data handling)

Jupyter Notebook / VSCode (recommended for running)
