# Customer Support Data Analysis (SQL + Python)

Welcome to this project where we explore a Customer Support database using SQL queries within a Python environment (using libraries like `sqlite3` and `pandas`).

This repository includes SQL scripts to perform various analyses, such as ticket volumes, agent performance, customer satisfaction (CSAT) scores, and more.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For executing SQL queries.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database.
- **Pandas**: For data handling.
- **Jupyter Notebook / VSCode**: Recommended for running the project.

## List of SQL Queries
1. **Display all records**
2. **Total number of support tickets**
3. **Tickets by channel**
4. **Average CSAT score by agent**
5. **Top 5 cities with most issues reported**
6. **Most common product issues**
7. **Average handling time by agent**
8. **CSAT score distribution**
9. **Issues by category and sub-category**
10. **Tickets handled by agent shift**

Each query helps uncover important insights into customer support operations and agent performance.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding visualizations for CSAT distribution and ticket trends.
- Automating reports for agent performance.
- Deploying as a lightweight dashboard app with Streamlit.
